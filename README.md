# My notebooks for Columbia University bootcamp 2019-08-26 & 27

These are my notebooks created in preparation for teaching a
[Foundations for Research Computing Bootcamp](https://columbiaswc.github.io/2019-08-26-columbia-section-1/)

Mostly they are just what I did to practice teaching. I don't intend to use them in class, but I'll have them handy
in case something goes wrong. Where I've added a few improvements, workarounds, or just humor, that is also here.
