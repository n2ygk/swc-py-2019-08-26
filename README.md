# My notebooks for Columbia University bootcamp 2019-08-26 & 27

Alan Crosswell

## What's here?

### Notebooks named [0-9][0-9]-*.ipynb
These are my notebooks created in preparation for teaching a
[Foundations for Research Computing Bootcamp](https://columbiaswc.github.io/2019-08-26-columbia-section-1/)
which is based on [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).

Mostly they are just what I did to practice teaching. I don't intend to use them in class, but I'll have them handy
in case something goes wrong. Where I've added a few improvements, workarounds, or just humor, that is also here.
See, especially: `10-lunch.ipynb` which demonstrates XKCD-style graphs.

### Notebooks created during the class

There are 5 or 6 sloppy notebooks that I created while teaching the second half -- Teddy taught the first half.
We intend to merge our repos at some point.

`fed.ipynb` was based on a discussion with one student after the class ended who wanted some hints on how to scrape
data from the Federal Reserve. We googled some stuff and then I finished up getting it sort-of-working the next day.

### International MacBook Keyboards

One or two students had non-US keyboards on their MacBooks. This led to problems finding some keys frequently
used with the Unix Shell and Python such as `~` (tilde), and `[]` (square brackets).  Also, some had difficulty
with `'` (single quote) and `"` (double-quote) marks.  See
[this Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794) for information about
international keyboard layouts and how to find those special keys.

(Those using Windows or Linux laptops who have had similar problems, please feel free to submit a PR to update this
README.)

### Accelerated Python

`ColumbiaU_Accelerated_Python.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook export of the Google Research Colab notebook for a
workshop recently taught by Sameer (Sam) Ansari of Google. Some students had asked about that, since it was "sold out"
and, also, novices were encourage to first learn the basics in the bootcamp.

## Issues and Pull Requests Encouraged

For more practice with the skills learned, students are encouraged to submit Issues and/or Pull Requests to, respectively,
complain about(:-) or improve these notebooks -- or just practice using git.
